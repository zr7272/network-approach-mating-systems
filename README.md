# network-approach-mating-systems
## A network approach to study animal mating systems

This repository includes Rcode that demonstrates how to construct a bipartite species-trait network and analyse it to find trait associations that resemble "mating system syndromes" that are candidates for being associated with mating systems.

A test data set is provided including traits from 12 spider species.
